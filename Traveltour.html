    <h2>MKO Abiola Gardens and Parks- Ketu,Lagos-Nigeria</h2>
    <p>My travel tour to MKO Abiola gardens and parks at Ketu</p>

    <p>Statue & park was dedicated to Nigeria's greatest statesman</p>

    <p>This is a symbolic park named after the iconic legend,<span style="color:purple; text-decoration: underline">Chief Moshood Abiola</span>. A politician who was widely regarded as the winner of the inconclusive 1993 Nigerian elections.</p>
    <p>Today, the park service expresses optimism that the monument will forever crystallize what he stood for during his lifetime. In <b>2018</b>, a park in Alapere,Ketu was named after him by the <b>Lagos state government</b></p>

    <p>I went to the park to take pictures for my photography assignment. I'm really proud such site of attraction was dedicated to Moshood Abiola.</p>
    <p>He was a man of honor who fought for democracy</p>

    <p>The park had beautiful sceneries though it needs more security because of the ketu opportunists. It requires maintenance too. But overall i loved it</p>
